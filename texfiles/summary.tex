\chapter{SUMMARY}

In this thesis, the control algorithm of the serial-parallel hybrid engine system with power-split-device consisting of an 
internal combustion engine and an electric motor is modeled. Modeling was done on MATLAB/Simulink platform. 
This environment was chosen because of the various built-in control libraries it offers and the option to simulate on a time
basis with custom libraries.

While designing the control algorithm, it is aimed to keep the battery state-of-charge level between certain values.
Doing so, the battery is always kept in the optimum working regions and high range was obtained.
The control algorithm was analyzed in different driving cycles that are widely accepted in the world. 
Different drive cycles are suitable for comparing objectively and to examine controller performance.
As a result of the analysis, the robustness of the controller is shown by showing that the battery 
state-of-charge level remains in the desired working regions in all driving cycles. This study also provides
guidance for future studies and controller algorithms.
